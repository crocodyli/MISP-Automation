# MISP Automations

The repository contains some of the main automations used in projects that I have developed and worked on focused on the usability of MISP in general.

Some of the automations involve the use of a TELEGRAM BOT to monitor events and receive alerts on your cell phone. (Very useful for monitoring events coming from specific organizations or with specific tags).

The scripts can be used as a basis for this.

It is also worth remembering that many of the MISP automations can be found in the official documentation of CERT Luxembourg and, of course, in the Workflows that make life easier.
